# Refactoring Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
An anlysis of stock outcomes for 12 companies for the years 2017 and 2018. 
### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to compare stock performance of a set group of stocks over a 2 year period. We will look at their performance to determine which stocks are consistently performing postively. 
## Analysis and Challenges

We will utilize an index for the ticker to give us greater flexibility if the array size needs to be adjusted as shown in the image below. This program will list out all of the stocks, and loop through them to get the Total Daily Volume as well as the Return.

 We will then compare our results from 2017 with 2018
