# Refactoring Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
An anlysis of stock outcomes for 12 companies for the years 2017 and 2018. 
### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to compare stock performance of a set group of stocks over a 2 year period. We will look at their performance to determine which stocks are consistently performing postively. 
## Analysis and Challenges

We will utilize an index for the ticker to give us greater flexibility if the array size needs to be adjusted.
